# Virtual-3D

This project involves creating a virtual 3D display that utilizes face tracking for head tracking. Specifically, I will employ OpenCV's Haar Cascade face tracker to ascertain a person's x, y, and z coordinates relative to a webcam. The virtual tunnel display will then be updated based on the user's position to produce a 3D effect.
